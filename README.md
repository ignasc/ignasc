## About Me
My name is Ignas, I am electrical engineer and I am learning programming, so that I could no longer have to be electrical engineer.

It all started a very long time age, when I did some basic programming with C++ and programmable microcontrollers. Then, throughout the years, I did some random coding/learning using different languages like C++, C#, Python, played around with Unity and Unreal game engines, did some random coding/learning using various tools like React, Redux, Django, Nodejs, Express, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes. And just not so long ago, I decided that it was enough goofing around and time to change career paths. So, here I am - learning to code, just this time with intention and goals!

## My current work
Current projects/activities:
* Refreshing my knowledge on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) using full stack JavaScript path as my main tech stack focus.
* Chipping away on [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) mini coding challenges, which you can find in my [repository](https://github.com/ignasc/coding_challenges_projecteuler).

I also have my own [portfolio](https://www.ignasc.lt/), which is running on raspberry pi, that is sitting in my room, under the desk. It showcases what I think are my best mini projects I have done so far and I am very proud of the progress! I will be looking to get to the point where this portfolio website would be containerized and automatically updated whenever it's repository gets a new commit as I would like to use my raspberry pi for other things, like smart home hub for example. P.S. this love for automation comes from my electrical engineering career or maybe I am just lazy and want to automate everything.
