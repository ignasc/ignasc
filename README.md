## About Me
My name is Ignas, I am electrical engineer and I am learning programming, so that I could no longer be electrical engineer.

It all started a very long time age, when I did some basic programming with C++ and programmable microcontrollers. Then, throughout the years, I did some random coding/learning using different languages like C++, C#, Python, played around with Unity and Unreal game engines, did some random coding/learning using various tools like React, Redux, Django, Nodejs, Express, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes. And just not so long ago, I decided that it is enough goofing around and time to change career paths. So, here I am - learning to code.

## My current work
Currently I am working on [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) mini coding challenges, which you can [find in my repository](https://github.com/ignasc/coding_challenges_projecteuler).

I also have my own [portfolio](https://www.ignasc.lt/), which is running on raspberry pi, that is sitting in my room, under the desk. It showcases what I think are my best mini projects I have done.
I am very proud of this! And I am looking to get to the point where this website would be containerized and automatically updated whenever it's repository gets a new commit. P.S. this love for automation comes from my electrical engineering career.

## Languages and tools
Most of the tools and languages, that I listed below, are the ones I am the most familiar with. Not necesarily good at them, but the ones I have spent the most time doing stuff and the ones I am most comfortable with to jump in and start working without the need to spend hours learning.
