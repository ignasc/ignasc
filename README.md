# About Me

My name is Ignas, I am electrical engineer and I am learning to code. Automation is the part I really like about electrical engineering and as I am learning to code, I enjoy the ability to automate things using computer programming languages.

It all started a very long time age, when I did some basic programming with C++ and programmable microcontrollers. Then, throughout the years, I did some random coding/learning out of curiosity using different languages and tools. And just not so long ago, I decided learning to code while being focused on intention and goals!

My favourite part is working on the back end of the whole full stack experience. Problem solving, algorithms, implementing logic, creating functions and the whole automation part is what I like the most from my current experience and progression in computer programming.

What I have learned over this period is that having a solid understanding of programming principles allows me to pick up any language/tool/framework and start learning it relatively easy, especially when I can learn by coding and analysing examples.

# My current activities and work

* Refreshing and improving my knowledge on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) using full stack JavaScript path as my main tech stack focus.

I am also hosting my own [portfolio](https://www.ignasc.lt/) on a server that is running on raspberry pi at home. Although my most recent details and projects are here on github and I will be looking to rebuild my website at some point in the future and potentially containerize everything to be able to use server for more than just a single website.

# Projects

Current projects that I think are worthy to showcase my skills. Some are quite old, the ones that I did with just basic knowledge, while others are more recent that include better coding practices and more advanced features like classes, modules and better version management using git.

## Tools
Tools listed below are the ones I have had a basic introduction to throughout courses, mini projects and coding challenges. While I would not be able to jump into them immediately, at the very least I have the understanding of basic principles and what pusposes these tools serve and it would be much easier to get up to speed with them than if I was to learn them from scratch.
